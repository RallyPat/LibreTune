# Change Annotations

Change annotations let you attach a short note to a tune commit. This makes it easier to understand *why* a change was made when reviewing history.

## Adding an Annotation

1. Open **Tools → Tune History**.
2. Click **Commit**.
3. Enter a commit message.
4. Enter an optional annotation when prompted.

Annotations are stored with the commit and shown directly in the history timeline.

## Recommended Use

- Summarize what you changed (e.g., “Leaned mid-load for smoother cruise”).
- Note test conditions (ambient temp, fuel type, boost level).
- Record why a rollback was needed.
